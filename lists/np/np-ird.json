    "en": "The Inland Revenue Department is responsible for the administration of Value Added Tax, Income Tax, and Excise Duty. In the performance of these duties it maintains a register of Permanent Account Numbers (PANs) the unique taxpayer identification number for Nepal.\n\nThis register covers individuals as well as legal entities. Org-id does not recommend using the PAN of an individual person as a unique identifier.\n\nThe PAN is described as follows [1]:\n\n- A unique identification number, which is issued to all the taxpayers and Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) withholding agents throughout the kingdom. \n- It identifies each taxpayer or TDS withholding agent uniquely countrywide.\n- It is necessary to process taxpayers or TDS withholding agents using computer systems.\n- It is allotted only once in the lifetime of a taxpayer or TDS withholding agent. It never changes.\n\n[1] https://nepaltradeportal.gov.np/resources/docs/IndividualRegistration(English)1172014102329AM.pdf"
