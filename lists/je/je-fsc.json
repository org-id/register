This legislation requires NPOs to register with the Commission in certain circumstances.  The definition of an NPO, as provided by Article 1 of the NPO Law, is given below:\n\n\u201cAn organization is a non-profit organization for the purposes of this Law if \u2013 \n(a) it is established solely or primarily for charitable, religious, cultural, educational, social,\n    or fraternal purposes with the intention of benefiting the public or a section of the public; and\n(b) it raises or disburses funds in pursuance of those purposes.\u201d \" [1]\n\n[1] http://www.jerseyfsc.org/anti-money_laundering/forms/NPO/index.asp"
