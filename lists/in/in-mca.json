    "en": "Companies in India register with the Registrar of Companies in their state. While each Registrar of Companies maintains their own database, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs regulates the corporate sector and maintains a database of national company information. \n\nCompanies are issued with a 21-digit alphanumeric Corporate Identification Number (CIN), and Limited Liability Partnerships with a Limited Liability Partnership Identification Number (LLPIN). Both of these can be used with the IN-MCA prefix. \n\n**More information**\n\n\"The Registrar of Companies (ROC) is an office under the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs that deals with administration of the Companies Act 1956 and Companies Act, 2013. There are currently 22 Registrars of Companies (ROC) operating from offices in all major states of India. Some states, such as Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, have two ROCs each. Section 609 of the Companies Act, 1956 tasks the ROCs with the primary duty of registering companies and LLPs floated in the respective states and the union territories under their administration.\n\nThe Registrar of Company takes care of company registration (also known as incorporation) in India, completes reporting and regulation of companies and their directors and shareholders, and also oversees government reporting of various matters including the annual filling of various documents.\" [1]\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registrar_of_Companies,_India\n"
