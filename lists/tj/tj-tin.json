    "en": "Under Tajik law, all legal entities — including NGOs — are required to register with the national tax authority (Tax Committee under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan). \n\nOnce the entity is registered with the tax authority:\n\n- the tax authority issues the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) to the organization\n- this number is assigned once and cannot be changed or reused, even if the entity is later dissolved\n- the entity typically receives a certificate confirming the assignment of the TIN from the tax authority.\n\nThe TIN is used for all official tax reporting, financial transactions, and interactions with tax authorities in Tajikistan.\n\nTINs consist of 9 digits. The specific structure includes:​ \n\n- First Part: Indicates the entity type or individual categorization.​ \n- Middle Section: A unique identifier related to individual or business registration numbers.​ \n- Last Section: Digits used for validation purposes.
