        "en": "OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) is the part of the United Nations Secretariat responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies. \n\nOCHA assigns it's own organisation identifiers to parties involved in funding or delivery of humanitarian work, which are used in UN OCHA data, and may be used by some third-parties.\n\nPreviously OCHA used identifiers from its Financial Tracking System (FTS) list. It has now changed and uses identifiers from its Humanitarian Programme Cycle (HPC) list. \n\nOrganisations may have different identifiers on the two lists. For example, if an organisation has a legacy code of XM-OCHA-FTS3524 then it does NOT automatically have a new code of XM-OCHA-HPC3524. The deprecated FTS identifier list is no longer available online."
